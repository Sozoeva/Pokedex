            Pokémon is a media franchise consisting of video games, serialized
            cartoons and films, trading cards, countless pieces of merchandise,
            and various other products. The franchise takes place in a shared
            universe in which humans co-exist with creatures called Pokémon, a
            large variety of species endowed with special powers. The world of
            Pokémon has three primary goals.

                Many Pokemon names are made up of numbers

              <p class="text sliderText">
                All Pokémon have very unusual names. To come up with so many
                names, their creators had to strain their imagination a lot.
                However, not everyone knows that some names even consist of
                numbers.

                Sometimes the family history of some Pokémon is very creepy, and
                Cubone is a great example of this. He belongs to the earth type,
                and no one has ever seen his face because of the mask (an alien
                skull over the monster's head).

                Slowpoke are considered a delicacy

              <p class="text sliderText">
                Many people think that Pokémon are only made to fight other
                Pokémon. However, the truth is that Pokémon are also food. In
                the earliest versions of the game, Slowpoke tails cost a lot of
                money and were considered a real delicacy.

              <p class="text sliderText">
                Many will say that the first Pokémon was invented by the cute
                Pikachu or Bulbasaur, but according to Ken Sugimori (Ken
                Sugimori, character designer of the Pokemon video game), the
                first hero drawn by the creators of the concept was Raydon.

                Although Munna was not introduced into the game until his fifth
                generation, there is a mention of a pink monster with flower
                patterns in the training session of the first generation of
                Pokémon, which matches the description of Munna.
